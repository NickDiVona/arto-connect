    artysReaction:
      'A Zerg player using Mutalisks usually are difficult for Artosis to deal with. If he did not build an Engineering Bay then he will not have turrets to defend his workers. The earlier the Zerg does this, the more trouble he seems to have. However, if the Zerg tries this in the later game, he is often able to shut it down with relative ease. '
